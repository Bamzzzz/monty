0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO,FIFO
This is a group project, we created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. 
The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.
Monty is a script language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). 
It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate.
